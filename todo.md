* It would be nice to eliminate the temporary credentials trap as much as possible. We can do this in two ways as long as we don't run into a flow that makes them impossible:
  * Write flows that don't need any credentials until the user has authorized the app. eg: Web Server and Implicit flows that send a code or token back safely instead of requiring credentials beforehand.
  * In flows where temporary credentials are used require the client to continually poll the authorization server while waiting for user authorization. This will allow us to use expiration times <5min and throw out the credentials as soon as the application closes causing it to stop polling.
* We will want to specify a way for clients to hint to resource servers [https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ext/language_preference/1.0/drafts/2/spec.html]
* Facebook has included a display={page,popup,touch} parameter into their OAuth flow. While we will want to ditch their naming and come up with something proper and independent; just like language preferences, the format that the request is being made in is something important that clients would want to convey to providers so that the providers can ensure that their flow pages look correct. [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/oauth/]
* Google's Implicit Token Flow implementation includes an extra way to validate a token and makes a compelling note that the flow is not secure without this step. We should probably include a validation of the token in our version of the Implicit Token Flow. However in our case since we want to work with signatures that need multiple parameters we will probably want to do this not by validating a token but instead by making our implicit flow return an authorization code just like the web server flow (but in the fragment instead) and exchange that for the real access token. The same redirect_uri validation used in authorization code checks can be used to secure the implicit flow from the issue. [https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2UserAgent#validatetoken]
* Facebook uses access token refreshing and also provides a web hook for when an app is deauthorized. These ideas could be useful. Though for a deauthorized hook a possibility besides using a signed request would be to make a query to the token endpoint ourselves to verify that the token has been purged.
